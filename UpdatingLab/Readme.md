This is the first of two separate labs given during the Azure Tour "Scenario" events. 

In this lab, we focus on helping developers migrate existing web sites, assets, and databases into Windows Azure.  

Each attendee must complete lab 1, but can then pick from one or more of the optional labs (2-4).  

There are four labs:

1. **(Required) "Moving a Local Web Site's Images to Cloud Storage"** - This lab verifies that attendee has an existing Windows Azure account, or that they create a free trial.  Then, using an existing site and database provided in the lab, they move the web site's images up into Azure Storage.  

2. **(Optional) "Moving a Local Web Site and Database to a Windows Azure Web Site and a Windows Azure SQL Database."** - This lab has the attendee migrate the local web site and database from the first lab into an Azure Web Site and Azure SQL Database.  

3. **(Optional) "Moving a Local Web Site and SQL Database to Windows Azure Virtual Machines"** - This lab has the attendee migrate the local web site and database from the first lab into two Azure VMs: 1 for the web site, 1 for the database. 

4. **(Optional) "Moving a Local Web Site and Database to a Windows Azure Cloud Service and Windows Azure SQL Database"** - This lab has the attendee move the local website and database from the first lab into an Azure SQL Database and a Web Role in an Azure Cloud Service.
