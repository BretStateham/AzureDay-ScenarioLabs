##Overview##

In this lab, you will first migrate a local SQL Database with all of it's existing data to a Windows Azure SQL Database.  

Once that is complete, you will then modify the local Web Site project to be deployable into a Windows Azure Cloud Service, and to consume data from the new Azure SQL Database.  

Finally, you will deploy the site into a new Windows Azure Cloud Service running the Windows Azure data centers.
