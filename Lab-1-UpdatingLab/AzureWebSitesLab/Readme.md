##Overview##

In this lab, you will first migrate a local SQL Database with all of it's existing data to a Windows Azure SQL Database.  

Once that is complete, you will then create a new Windows Azure Web Site and publish the local site to it.  As part of the publication, you will modify the database connection strings to point to the new Azure SQL Database created above.
