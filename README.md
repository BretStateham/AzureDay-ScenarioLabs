2. Configuration, Dev, Test Labs - ?

##Agenda##

|Time|Activity|
|-----------------|--------|
|8:30am – 9:00am  |Guest arrival, Registration, Continental Breakfast, Guest Setup	Check in, grab a set and get setup. This is the time to sign up for a free $200 Windows Azure credit, and configure any software needed. During the first hour the lab handlers will work with guests to verify the prerequisites were installed and assist where needed.|
|9:00am – 9:30am  |Overview of the Microsoft Modern Platform	The speaker will explain the application platform story for the Modern Microsoft era. They will discuss the continuity across tools and APIs across devices, services, on-premises, and cloud.|
|9:30am – 10:30am |A look at the Modern Principles	This session will focus on what the modern principles are, and the steps needed to evolve a common on-premises system architecture to something that is more modern. We will discuss the tenants of modern architecture, and why they are important. For the whole discussion we will use a sample scenario. This session will walk through the current state of the system including an overview of the possible changes that can be made to update to a more modern style. Cost will be discussed as a factor in the decisions. One element to be discussed is the manual work needed, testing, risks of change, and how to get the most bang for the buck. The rest of the cloud OS platform story will be woven into this talk.|
|10:30am – 10:45am|AM Break|
|10:45am – 12:45pm|Updating an app to a Modern Architecture (Hands-on Lab with step by step instructions and screenshots) & Lunch – This is a working lunch. Lunch will be served, and guests can eat and work at their own pace.	The attendees will take the existing app, and choose one of two ways to modernize it. They will follow a lab for each of the two choices. The first will be to ‘lift and shift’, which will involve a Virtual Machine lab. The second option will be to rework it so it can be deployable to a cloud services environment. The third option, time permitting, would allow guests to rework the app on Mobile Services.|
|12:45pm – 1:45pm |Introduction to Modern Dev/Test Practices	In this presentation and demo the speaker will go through the various uses of Windows Azure for dev and test scenarios. The content will call out common current day flaws in testing such as don’t test at all, poor/incomplete hardware, out of date builds in QA, can’t test to scale, and several more. The demos will include getting a free Windows Azure trial, and building/deploying a simple ASP.NET MVC4 app for testing. |
|1:45pm – 2:00pm  |PM Break|
|2:00pm – 4:00pm  |Configuring and Testing a Modern Application (Hands-on Lab with step by step instructions and screenshots)	This hands-on lab will have attendees deploy a pre-built web application for testing. They will learn how to configure and deploy Virtual Machines in Windows Azure, and how to configure them for easy code deployment and load testing. They will also deploy the same web application to a website for easy manual testing by a QA department or customer.|
|4:00pm – 4:30pm  |Closing Remarks / Questions & Guest Departure|
